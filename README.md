# Runelite Item Comparison
Allows you to compare 2 items stats in the sidebar of Runelite, 
instead of having to load the wiki in your browser or go to the GE.

It works by querying the Wiki API for the input item names, and loads the
page contents, parses the text and tries to find the item stats.

Some items may be incompatible due to the way their data is laid out on their Wiki page. 
If you find one, create an issue on my Github and I'll check it out.
